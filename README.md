This batch data pipeline collects user data and creates a user profile. We are building a data pipeline to populate the user_behavior_metric table. The user_behavior_metric table is an OLAP table used by analysts, dashboard software, etc. It is built from:

1. user_purchase: OLTP table with user purchase information.
2. movie_review.csv: Data is sent every day by an external data vendor.
